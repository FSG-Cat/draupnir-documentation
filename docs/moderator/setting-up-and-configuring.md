# Quick start

When you first get your Draupnir there are a few steps you should take
so that your community is protected. Along the way, if you struggle at
any point you can find reference documentation for each command by
using `!draupnir help`.

1. [Managing protected rooms](./managing-protected-rooms.md) -
   choosing which rooms to be protected by Draupnir.
2. [Managing policy lists](./managing-policy-lists.md) - how to create
   or watch lists created by other communities.
3. [Managing users](./managing-users.md) - How to ban, remove and
   manage the power level of users.
4. [Managing protections](../protections) - Modules
   that offer extra functionality.
