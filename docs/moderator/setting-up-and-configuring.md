## Quick start

When you first get your Draupnir there are a few steps you should take so
that your community is protected.

1. [Managing protected rooms](./managing-protected-rooms.md) - choosing which rooms to be protected by Draupnir.
2. [Managing policy lists](./managing-policy-lists.md) - how to create or watch lists created by other communities.
3. [Managing users](./managing-users.md) - How to ban, remove and manage the power level of users.
