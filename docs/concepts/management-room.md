The management room is where you will interact with Draupnir. This is the room
where Draupnir will respond to commands, allowing you to coordinate with
Draupnir and other moderators without disrupting your public Matrix rooms.

The management room should not be public, as anyone present in this room can
perform any action supported by the bot.
